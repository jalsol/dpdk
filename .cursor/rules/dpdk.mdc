I am an intern at an HFT firm. My task is to talk about Linux driver. The description of my task is:

>How to write a driver, and how to move stuff to userspace. Something like a kernel-bypass networking.

I want to talk about normal driver, then kernel-bypass driver, then some benchmarks with scenarios mimicking typical HFT settings.
